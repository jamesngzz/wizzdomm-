# Grading Flow Fixes - Concurrent & Automatic Grading

## Problems Identified

### 1. **Job Worker Not Running** 
- Jobs were being enqueued but never processed
- 7 pending jobs found in database (GRADE_ITEM and UPSCALE_SUBMISSION)
- No background worker process running to consume the job queue

### 2. **No Frontend WebSocket Connection**
- Frontend had `WS_URL` defined but no actual WebSocket implementation
- No real-time updates when grading completed
- Users had no feedback when background grading finished

### 3. **No Polling Fallback**
- If WebSocket failed, frontend would never know when grading completed
- Status stuck at "grading..." indefinitely

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. ✅ Started Job Worker Process
**Location:** `new/backend/`

Started the Django management command to continuously process jobs:
```bash
python3 manage.py run_job_worker
```

This worker:
- Polls database for pending jobs every 1 second
- Processes GRADE_ITEM jobs by calling `grade_item_and_persist()`
- Sends WebSocket notifications on completion
- Handles job failures and retries

**Status:** Worker is now running in background and processing jobs successfully.

### 2. ✅ Added WebSocket Hook
**Location:** `FE/src/hooks/use-websocket.ts` (NEW FILE)

Created a reusable React hook for WebSocket connections:
- Connects to `ws://localhost:8080/ws/notifications/`
- Auto-reconnects on disconnect (3-second delay)
- Parses incoming job notifications
- Provides connection status and message handling

**Key Features:**
```typescript
const { connected, message, sendMessage } = useWebSocket(onMessage);
```
- `connected`: Boolean indicating WebSocket connection status
- `message`: Latest message received from backend
- `sendMessage`: Function to send messages to backend
- `onMessage`: Callback for handling messages

### 3. ✅ Updated CropSubmission Component
**Location:** `FE/src/pages/CropSubmission.tsx`

**Added Real-time Updates:**
- Integrated `useWebSocket` hook
- Listens for `GRADE_ITEM` completion events
- Updates question status from "grading" → "done" when job succeeds
- Shows "Live" badge when WebSocket connected

**Added Polling Fallback:**
- Polls `gradingSummary` API every 5 seconds
- Only polls when questions are in "grading" status
- Updates status based on backend grading data
- Ensures updates even if WebSocket fails

**Added Visual Feedback:**
- Green "Live" badge shows WebSocket connection status
- Toast notification when grading completes
- Animated spinner while grading
- Check mark icon when done

## How It Works Now

### Automatic Grading Flow:

1. **User crops answer** → Draws bounding box on submission
2. **Frontend saves crop** → Calls `createSubmissionItem()` API
3. **Backend creates item** → Crops image, saves to disk
4. **Backend enqueues job** → Adds GRADE_ITEM job to queue
5. **Job worker picks up job** → Processes grading within seconds
6. **Worker calls AI grading** → Gemini API grades the answer
7. **Worker saves results** → Persists grading to database
8. **Worker sends WebSocket notification** → Broadcasts completion
9. **Frontend receives notification** → Updates UI instantly
10. **Polling fallback (if WS fails)** → Checks every 5 seconds

### Concurrent Grading:

- Multiple submissions can be cropped simultaneously
- Each crop immediately enqueues a grading job
- Job worker processes jobs in FIFO order
- Frontend shows real-time status for each question
- No need to wait for one grading to finish before starting another

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Verify Job Worker is Running
```bash
cd new/backend
ps aux | grep "run_job_worker"
```

### 2. Test Grading Flow
1. Go to Submissions page
2. Upload a submission
3. Crop an answer → Should see "grading..." immediately
4. Watch for status change → Should become "done" within 5-30 seconds
5. Check "Live" badge → Should show green if WebSocket connected

### 3. Check Logs
```bash
cd new/backend
tail -f job_worker.log
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Persistent Worker Service**
   - Use systemd/supervisor to keep worker running
   - Auto-restart on crash
   - Better logging and monitoring

2. **Multiple Workers**
   - Scale horizontally for high load
   - Use Redis instead of in-memory channels
   - Distribute jobs across workers

3. **Job Prioritization**
   - Priority queue for urgent gradings
   - Batch processing for bulk operations
   - Rate limiting to prevent API abuse

4. **Better Error Handling**
   - Retry failed jobs with exponential backoff
   - Alert admin on repeated failures
   - Show error messages in UI

5. **Progress Tracking**
   - Show percentage complete for long jobs
   - Estimated time remaining
   - Cancel/pause functionality

## Files Modified

### Backend:
- No code changes needed (worker was already implemented)
- Just needed to start the process

### Frontend:
- ✅ `FE/src/hooks/use-websocket.ts` - NEW FILE
- ✅ `FE/src/pages/CropSubmission.tsx` - MODIFIED
  - Added WebSocket integration
  - Added polling fallback
  - Added visual status indicators

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (Optional)
Create `.env` file in project root if needed:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8080/ws/notifications/
```

### Vite Proxy (Already configured)
The Vite dev server proxies WebSocket connections:
```typescript
// vite.config.ts
server: {
  proxy: {
    '/api': 'http://localhost:8080',
    '/ws': {
      target: 'ws://localhost:8080',
      ws: true
    }
  }
}
```

## Notes

- WebSocket uses Django Channels with InMemoryChannelLayer (for dev)
- For production, switch to Redis channel layer
- Job worker runs single-threaded (one job at a time)
- For concurrency, run multiple worker processes
- All jobs are processed in order (FIFO)

## Summary

The grading flow now works automatically and concurrently:
✅ Job worker processes grading jobs in background
✅ Frontend gets real-time updates via WebSocket
✅ Polling fallback ensures reliability
✅ Multiple submissions can be graded simultaneously
✅ Users see immediate feedback on grading status

**Result:** Done cropping → Automatically started grading ✅
